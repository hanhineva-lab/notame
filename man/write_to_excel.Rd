\description{
Writes all the data in a SummarizedExperiment or MetaboSet object to an 
Excel spreadsheet.
The format is similar to the one used to read data in, except for the fact 
that EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN AS TEXT. To fix numeric values in Excel,
choose any cell with a number, press Ctrl + A, then go to the dropdown menu
in upper left corner and choose "Convert to Number". This will fix the file,
but can take quite a while.
