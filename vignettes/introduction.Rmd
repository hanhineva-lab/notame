# Motivation

From the perspective of metabolites as the continuation of the central dogma of 
biology, metabolomics provides the closest link to many phenotypes of interest. 
This makes metabolomics research promising in teasing apart the complexities of 
living systems, attracting many new practitioners.

The *notame* R package was developed in parallel with an associated protocol 
article as a general guideline for data analysis in untargeted 
metabolomics studies [@notame]. The main outcome is identifying interesting 
features for laborious downstream steps relating to biological context, such as 
metabolite identification and pathway analysis, which fall outside the purview 
of *notame*. Bioconductor packages with complementary functionality in 
Bioconductor include pmp, phenomis and qmtools; *notame* brings partially 
overlapping and new functionality to the table. There are also Bioconductor 
packages for preprocessing, metabolite identification and pathway analysis. 
Together, *notame*, Bioconductor's dependency management and other Bioconductor 
functionality allow for quality, reproducible metabolomics research.

# Installation
To install *notame*, install BiocManager first, if it is not installed. 
Afterwards use the install function from BiocManager.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("notame")
library(notame)
```

# How it works
SummarizedExperiment is the primary data structure of this package. The 
functionality of *notame* can be broadly divided into data pretreatment and 
feature selection, excluding preprocessing and functionality related to 
biological context (Figure 1). Data pretreatment involves reducing unwanted
variation and data preparation dependent on downstream methods. The many 
visualizations used for inspecting the data pretreatment process also serve as 
exploratory data analysis. Feature selection aims to select a subset of 
interesting features across study groups before laborious steps relating to 
biological context. Please see the documentation for an overview 
of functionality (?notame), the Project Example vignette for usage and the 
associated protocol article for more information [@notame].

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#| fig.cap = "Overview of untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data analysis."
knitr::include_graphics("Overview.png")
```

## Input
Data can be read with `import_from_excel()`, which includes checks and 
preparation of metadata. To accommodate typical output from peak-picking 
software such as Agilent's MassHunter or MS-DIAL, the output is transformed 
into a spreadsheet for `import_from_excel()`. Alternatively, data in R can be 
wrangled and passed to the `construct_metabosets()` or `SummarizedExperiment()` 
constructor. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#| fig.cap = "Structure of spreadsheet for import_from_excel()."
knitr::include_graphics("Data_input.png")
```

There are a few obligatory fields for `import_from_excel()`, including 
"Injection_order" in sample information, "Mass" or "Average mz" in feature data 
and "Retention time", "RetentionTime", "Average rt(min)" or "rt" in feature 
information (not case sensitive). There are further optional fields, including 
"Sample_ID" and "QC" in sample data as well as "Feature_ID" in feature data, 
which are automatically generated if unavailable. One or more fields in feature 
data can be used to split the data into parts, usually LC column x ionization 
mode, supplied as arguments to the `split_by` parameter. If the file only 
contains one mode, specify the name of the mode, e.g. "HILIC_pos" to the `name` 
parameter. 

## Data pretreatment
Data pretreatment functions return modified objects and are largely 
based on pooled QC samples [@qcguidelines]. Data pretreatment is generally 
performed separately for each mode. The visualizations used to monitor data 
pretreatment are saved to file by default, but can also be returned as ggplot 
objects. The `visualizations()` wrapper can be used for saving visualizations 
at different stages of data pretreatment.

## Feature selection
Univariate statistics functions return a `data.frame`, to be manually 
filtered before inclusion into the feature data of the instance. Supervised 
learning functions return various data structures. 

Comprehensive results visualizations are returned as ggplot objects and can be 
saved to file using `save_plot()`. Interesting features can be inspected with 
feature-wise visualizations which are saved to file by default but can be 
returned as a list.

## Utilities
General utilities include `combined_data()` for representing the instance in a
`data.frame` suitable for plotting and various functions for data wrangling. 
For keeping track of the analysis, *notame* offers a logging system operated 
using `init_log()`, `log_text()` and `finish_log()`. *notame* also keeps track 
of all the external packages used, offering you references for each. To see and 
log a list of references, use `citations()`.

Parallellization is used in many feature-wise calculations and is provided by 
the BiocParallel package. BiocParallel defaults to a parallel backend. For 
small-scale testing on Windows, it can be quicker to use serial execution:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
BiocParallel::register(BiocParallel::SerialParam())
```

# Authors & Acknowledgements

The first version of *notame* was written by Anton Klåvus for his master's 
thesis in Bioinformatics at Aalto university (published under former name Anton 
Mattsson), while working for University of Eastern Finland and Afekta 
Technologies. The package is inspired by analysis scripts written by Jussi 
Paananen and Oskari Timonen. The algorithm for clustering molecular features 
originating from the same compound is based on MATLAB code written by David 
Broadhurst, Professor of Data Science & Biostatistics in the School of Science, 
and director of the Centre for Integrative Metabolomics & Computational Biology 
at the Edith Covan University.

All contributions to the package are always welcome!
