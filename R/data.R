#' Toy data set
#'
#' Contains imaginary data used in testing the package functions.
#' This dataset includes multiple observations from same subjects,
#' sampled at two timepoints in separate batches and divided to two groups. 
#' Note that across batches, the features don't have different feature ID's, 
#' m/z and retention time as would be the case with real-world data. In 
#' essence, the example data reflects that features were aligned perfectly 
#' between batches, for example using the align_batches function.

#' The dataset has 30 samples and 20 features.
