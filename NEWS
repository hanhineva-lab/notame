Changes in version 0.99.0
- submitted to Bioconductor
- SummarizedExperiment-support
- parallelization with BiocParallel
- removed functionality for using MetaboSet grouping slots (group_col etc.) as default values to facilitate parallel SummarizedExperiment implementation, concerns visualizations and univariate statistics
- removed exports with replacement: perform_t_test() now covers functionality of removed perform_paired_t_test() and perform_pairwise_t_test(). Similarly, perform_non_parametric() now covers functionality of removed perform_wilcoxon_signed_rank() and perform_pairwise_non_parametric()
- de-exported: low-level functionality for drift correction and feature clustering
- removed deprecated exports: dobc(), merge_batches()
- removed exports with external replacement: align_batches() and normalize_batches() will be available with SummarizedExperiment in the batchCorr package
- removed functions for various reasons: install_dependencies(), merge_exprs(), plot_sample_suprahex(), prop_found(), prop_na(), finite helpers such as finite_mean()
- renamed exports: clean_stats_results() renamed to summarize_results()
